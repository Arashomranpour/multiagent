# MultiAgent RAG System

This project implements a Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The goal is to enhance response generation by incorporating multiple agents that retrieve relevant information from different sources and collaborate to provide well-informed responses. This approach leverages the power of both language modeling and retrieval-based systems.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Multiple agents work together to retrieve and generate responses.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval of relevant documents with generation using a pre-trained language model.
- **Dynamic Query Handling**: Supports dynamic queries by retrieving documents and generating responses based on the most relevant information.
- **Modular Design**: Agents are modular, allowing for the addition of more specialized agents for different tasks.

## Project Structure

- `multiagentRAG.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the MultiAgent RAG system.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies needed for the project.
- `README.md`: Overview and documentation of the project.

## Installation and Setup

To set up this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Arashomranpour/multiagent.git
    cd multiagent
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:
    Launch `multiagentRAG.ipynb` in Jupyter and run the cells to execute the system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `transformers`: Hugging Face's transformer library for the language model.
- `faiss`: Library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- `langchain`: Framework for building agents that can use LLMs, tools, and knowledge bases.
- Jupyter Notebook (to run `.ipynb` files)

## Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can execute the notebook, which will:
- Initialize multiple agents.
- Perform document retrieval based on input queries.
- Generate responses using retrieved documents.
The agents collaborate to refine the final answer, ensuring more relevant and accurate results.

## Future Enhancements

- **Custom Agents**: Introduce agents specialized in particular domains to handle more complex queries.
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve retrieval and generation speed for large datasets.
- **Integration with External APIs**: Allow agents to fetch real-time data from APIs for more dynamic responses.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, submit issues, or create pull requests to enhance the system.
